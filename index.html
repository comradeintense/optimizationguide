## Part I
### Intro
Greetings! I am “**ComradeIntense**” and I am here to show you a couple of tips and tricks on how to better optimize in terms of performance your assets for **Cities Skylines**.  

What you will read further on, are things that I learned on my own in this journey, or things that have been taught to me by others (mostly my mentor -  **Ronyx69**) or at work, and I just want to pass the knowledge to others as well. If there is something you disagree with in this guide, don’t hesitate to contact and correct me, I am learning as well.
